        -	At some point in our existence, we come into consciousness. Before then, we are learning, living in the dark. Not sure where we are or what we see, it becomes your goal to find an identity. Most wander, but never locate.<br><br>
        
            Why does a newborn cry? Are they upset? Are they scared? Or maybe, they are unsure of where they are. Now, helpless in a world they did not ask to be brought into, they must learn to exist. As a newborn grows from birth, they constantly receive information. The moment we enter this world, said John Locke, “The mind is a blank slate on which experience writes (Dewall, Myers, 2015). <br><br>
            Accepting this idea, a newborn begins to adapt to the surrounding environment. I argue, most just attempt to exist. Too-focused on the opinion of others they forget to consider themselves.  Far too many walk-through life with no direction. Instead, they rather follow the path led by another. This is what I define as the dark; a place where you do not think for yourself. A place where you are not seen for your individuality but rather as a function. But this is not your fault. You have been conditioned to think this way, to serve as a component to the machine. <br><br>
            This machine I preach of, is just a system built to control.
            It becomes your fault every moment you refuse to recognize the machine. Maybe you have considered an idea similar to this but justifying your placement within is only a burden to yourself. If you compromise your worth to satisfy others, you will never find yourself. Now, this does not mean one day you will wake up and claim an identity, that would be frivolous. The goal of this life is to search, but not aimlessly. I would call it a balance.<br><br>
            A balance between purpose and question. If you do not question where you are and what you are meant to do, then you can never be certain about your purpose. But the moment you have settled on a purpose, is the moment you no longer question your worth. This is where I claim the goal of this life is to never stop learning. Learning about the environment you inhabit and the skills you have acquired to manipulate it.

    <br><a name="Commandment2"><font color="FF0000"><strong>2. Light</strong></font></a><br>

        -	To reach a sense of awareness, the 6th sense, one must recognize their potential. To think is to question. It is a sin to sloth your imagination. You are only as real as you can interpretate and communicate.<br><br>

            What does it mean to be aware? Are you now able to reason? Can you consider the logical forces acting upon an event? I argue, most never reach a state of self-awareness. This can only be achieved when one disconnects from contemporary boundaries.<br><br>
            These “boundaries” have been established to influence the meaning of life. Many wake up, go to work, then maybe enjoy a few hours of pleasure, to only sleep in preparation of this monotonous cycle. The first step when finding light is to break out of the loop. You must abandon the idea that this life revolves around serving another for your own welfare.<br><br>
            Now, this does not mean we twist the idea of helping another, that’s the point of this scripture, but we must be able to help ourselves first. Otherwise, we are only just a slave to the machine. Slavery still exists, just only in a discrete fashion. One that has been designed to make you think you are happy.<br><br>
            How do we measure happiness? Is this a collective matter or a personal one? Can we be happy alone or do we need to be surrounded by those who share the same feelings. Well, once again I argue it is a balance. You cannot allow your worth to be contingent on the opinion of another, but you also do not want to live with a self-righteous attitude. Both of which will damn your emotions.<br><br>
            I believe, it is best to be flexible. Most things never go as planned, but sometimes this change of events can result in a situation you never expected. Something that is euphoric.<br><br> 
            Euphoria, a feeling of extreme pleasure. Is too much intoxicating? Or is too little depressing? Before you can determine what is correct, one must consider their interests. A wise man once said to me, “John, you can do anything you want in this world, but you cannot do it all.” This has been the cornerstone to my personal value.<br><br>
            The idea that a balance once again emerges should begin to prime you, as the reader, that a constant state of equilibrium governs our existence. We all have good days, and we all have bad days. But, if we did not have one, would we be able to recognize the other?<br><br>
            This is where I proclaim a sense of awareness. If you can understand this, then you have already reached what I consider to be the light. Now no longer in the dark, you can see life for what it is, an imperfect discovery of the self.

    <br><a name="Commandment3"><font color="FF0000"><strong>3. Illumination</strong></font></a><br>

        -	To be wise, is to be damned.<br><br>

            Now that you can see the light, are you willing to look into it [En Lux]? Are you willing to explore the light or just acknowledge the existence of it? I say it is a life-long investigation into the unknown. You can never be for sure of what you think, but you can become more certain about what you believe.<br><br>
            This is what I consider to be a higher state of awareness. One where you recognize the infinite unknown but then accept to discover its power. John Barrow once wrote, “A brain simple enough to be understood is too simple to produce a mind able to understand it.” <br><br>
            For if we knew it all we would have nothing to learn. We can never know it all, but that’s the mystery to life. We get to choose what and how we discover knowledge. What is worth remembering and what is not. Sometimes, its best not to remember at all.

        Twin flames is an ancient concept dating back to Aristotle and Plato, the fathers of modern philosophy.<br><br>
        To quote Aristotle “Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.”<br><br>
        Plato said, “And when one of them meets with his other half, the actual half of himself, the pair are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy and one will not be out of sight of the other even for a moment”.<br><br>

        -	“The darkest people reflect the most light.” – The Angel Gabryeal R.<br><br>
        How do we recognize a fallen angel? Are we afraid of their presence? Or are we fearful of their power. I argue, they are a divine creature of the physical world. Sure, they have been tested by Gods wraith numerous times, but no matter the trial they always prevail. Many wish to commit evil deeds to others or even themselves.<br><br>
        But this is self-destructive. This is prideful. The ability to acknowledge the outcome of such decisions allows an angel to diffuse their rage. Angels have a special purpose. To serve and to protect. God has shown them true evil. Angels themselves commit evil deeds, but not without a purpose. <br><br>
        God does not spite them, or provoke them to act out in rage, but rather allow them to recognize what is truly evil. Far too often, an angel will never disclose their pain to the world. God would not have chosen them to be strong if they could not handle the pain. <br><br>
        <center><strong>Thesis: The purpose of an angel is to lift the spirit of another: To bring the world a sense of hope when faced with doubt.</strong></center><br> 
        One of the most self-harming things one can do, is doubt. Doubt their ability to accomplish or to change. This mindset will only damn your dreams from becoming a reality. Maybe you suffer from addiction. Doubting your ability to change will only keep you subsisting in pain.<br><br>
        The phrase, “Misery loves company” is often misunderstood. Your addiction is caused from a depressed mindset, and this depression wants to be accompanied with an addiction. Something to mask the pain. Something that will distract you from acknowledging your ability to change.<br><br>
        Alcohol, eating disorders, self-harm... all of which and many more are only just an attempt to fight your depression. But the truth is, it stops you from changing. It stops you from wanting to find happiness. You see, one can become addicted to a certain kind of sadness. One that justifies the way you are and not how you wish to be.<br><br>  
        So how do we change our ways? Well first, one must fully recognize their problem(s) and the reason for their existence. This may sound cliché, but if you continue to reflect on the past, then you will never be able to look forward. The brain can only focus on so much, so why focus on the things we cannot change. Maybe, the mistakes we made in the past are lessons for how we are to handle the future. We all make mistakes but refusing to change will only allow these mistakes to further control our actions.<br><br> 
        God does not consider a man to be wise if he makes the same mistake. God wants you to learn; about yourself and the world we inhabit together. We’re always going to have problems, but a wise man does not allow them to interfere with his ability to solve them.<br><br>
        Problems arise every day but failing to find a solution will only make them worst. Now this does not mean it is easy to solve just any problem but trying allows one to work towards “a” solution. In the beginning, it may not be so clear but as we take the steps to climb, we often get a better view.<br><br> 
        This does not imply though, that it is best to solve our problems alone. We are a social species; chances are somebody else has already encountered such problem or are battling with it now. The moment we open up about our problems, is the same moment we acknowledge their existence. If we conceal these problems, we will only be controlled by them.<br><br>
        When we begin to work with others, we start to find common ground. One that allows us to associate on a spiritual level.

        Solipsism (/ ˈsɒlɪpsɪzəm / (listen); from Latin solus 'alone', and ipse 'self') is the philosophical idea that only one's mind is sure to exist. As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure; the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind.
